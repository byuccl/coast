.. This document explains the LLVM passes used to implement COAST

Passes
********

COAST consists of a series of LLVM passes. The source code for these passes is found in the "projects" folder. This section covers the different passes available and their functions.

Description
=============

- **CFCSS**\ : This implements a form of Control Flow Checking via Software Signatures [#f1]_\ . Basic blocks are assigned static signatures in compilation. When the code is executing it compares the current signature to the known static signature. This allows it to detect errors in the control flow of the program.
- **dataflowProtection**\ : This is the underlying pass behind the DWC and TMR passes.
- **debugStatements**\ : On occasion programs will compile properly, but the passes will introduce runtime errors. Use this pass to insert print statements into every basic block in the program. When the program is then run, it is easy to find the point in the LLVM IR where things went awry. Note that this incurs a **very** large penalty in both code size and runtime.
- **DWC**\ : This pass implements duplication with compare (DWC) as a form of data flow protection. DWC is also known as dual modular redundancy (DMR). It is based on EDDI [#f2]_. Behind the scenes, this pass simply calls the dataflowProtection pass with the proper arguments.
- **exitMarker**\ : For software fault injection we found it helpful to have known breakpoints at the different places that ``main()`` can return. This pass places a function call to a dummy function, ``EXIT MARKER``, immediately before these return statements. Breakpoints placed at this function allow debuggers to access the final processor state.
- **TMR**\ : This pass implements triple modular redundancy (TMR) as a form of data flow protection. It is based on SWIFT-R [#f3]_ and Trikaya [#f4]_. Behind the scenes, this pass simply calls the dataflowProtection pass with the proper arguments.
- **smallProfile**\ : This pass can be used to collect dynamic function call counts.

Configuration Options
======================

COAST can be configured to apply replicating rules in other ways than by the default using :ref:`coast_cli_params`, :ref:`in_code_directives`, and a :ref:`coast_conf_file`.


.. _coast_cli_params:

Command Line Parameters
-------------------------

These options are only applicable to the ``-DWC`` and ``-TMR`` passes.

The details for each of these options can be found in the :ref:`repl_details` section.

Configuration File
--------------------

Instead of repeating the same command line options across several compilations, we have created a configuration file, "functions.config" that can capture the same behavior. It is found in the "dataflowProtection" pass folder. The location of this file can be specified using the ``-configFile=<...>`` option. The options are the same as the command line alternatives.

The `default file`_ contains functions we have identified as commonly treated differently than the default COAST options.

Replication Rules
-------------------

VAR3+, the set of replication rules introduced by Chielle et al. [#f5]_\ , instructs that all registers and instructions, except store instructions, should be duplicated. The data used in branches, the addresses before stores and jumps, and the data used in stores are all synchronized and checked against their duplicates. VAR3+ claims to catch 95% of data errors, so we used it as a starting point for automated mitigation. However, we removed rule D2, which does not replicate store instructions, in favor of D1, which does. This results in replication of all variables in memory, and is desirable as microcontrollers have no guarantee of protected memory. The synchronization rules are included in both DWC and TMR protection. Rules C1 and C2, synchronizing before each read and write on the register, respectively, are not included in our pass because these were shown to provide an excessive amount of synchronization. G1, replicating all registers, and C6, synchronizing before branch or store instructions, cannot be disabled as these are necessary for the protection to function properly.

The first option, ``-noMemReplication``, should be used whenever memory has a separate form of protection, such as error correcting codes (ECC). The option specifies that neither store instructions nor variables should be replicated. This can dramatically speed up the program because there are fewer memory accesses. Loads are still executed repeatedly from the same address to ensure no corruption occurs while processing the data.

The option ``-noStoreAddrSync`` corresponds to C5. In EDDI, memory was simply duplicated and each duplicate was offset from the original value by a constant. However, COAST runs before the linker, and thus has no notion of an address space. We implement rules C3 and C5, checking addresses before stores and loads, for data structures such as arrays and structs that have an offset from a base address. These offsets, instead of the base addresses, are compared in the synchronization logic.

.. versionchanged:: 1.2

As of the October 2019 release, COAST no longer syncs before storing data.  Test data indicated that, in many cases, the number of synchronization points generated by this rule limited the effective protection that the replication of variables afforded.  This behavior can be overridden using the ``-storeDataSync`` flag.

The user can specify any functions and global variables that should not be protected using ``-ignoreFns`` and ``-ignoreGlbls``. At minimum, these options should be used to exclude code that interacts with hardware devices (GPIO, UART) from the SoR. Replicating this code is likely to lead to errors. The option ``-replicateFnCalls`` causes user functions to be called in a coarse grained way, meaning the call is replicated instead of fine-grained instruction replication within the function body. Library function calls can also be excluded from replication via the flag ``-skipLibCalls``, which causes those calls to only be executed once. These two options should be used when multiple independent copies of a return value should be generated, instead of a single return value propagating through all replicated instructions. Changing the scope of replication can cause problems across function calls.

.. versionadded:: 1.2

Before processing the IR code, COAST begins by checking to make sure the replication scope rules it was given are consistent.  It checks to make sure all cloned globals are only used in functions that are also protected.  If they are not, the compilation will fail, with an error message informing the user which global is used in which function.  The user has the option to ignore these checks if they feel that it is safe.  This is done using the ``__COAST_IGNORE_GLOBAL`` macro mentioned above.

.. versionadded:: 1.4

There are also some options that have been added that allow more fine-grained control over how different functions and values are protected.  The first of these is the command line argument ``-cloneReturn``, or directive ``__xMR_RET_VAL``.  This instructs COAST that the return value of the function should be cloned.  This has been implemented by adding extra arguments to the end of the parameter list that are pointer types of the normal return value.  This prevents the values from passing through a bottleneck.  This is particulary useful for functions that return addresses to memory spaces that have been dynamically allocated.

Another recently added option is the ability to mark functions as "protected library functions" (``-protectedLibFn=<X>``, ``__xMR_PROT_LIB``).  The idea behind this is that there are some functions that should not have their signatures changed, but should still have their bodies protected.

Another interesting feature added in this version is the ability to copy the value of the original variable into its clone(s) *after* the function call has been completed.  An example of when this might be useful is the function `sscanf <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/sscanf/>`_.  This function will read values from a string based on a format specifier and put the values into the pointers provided.

.. code-block:: c

  sscanf (sentence,"%s %*s %d",str,&i);

This will allow the copies of the variables to stay in sync with each other even when calling a library function that can only be called once, that modifies a variable by reference.

We have introduced a way to mark functions as Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs), which means they will not be changed in any way, nor removed if they don't appear to have any uses.

COAST now has much better support for changing the protection of variables that are local to protected functions.  They can be excluded from the Scope of Replication using the macro ``__NO_xMR``.  Even function arguments can be excluded using the macro ``__NO_xMR_ARG(num)``.


Other Options
----------------

**Error Logging**\ : This option was developed for tests in a radiation beam, where upsets are stochastically distributed, unlike fault injection tests where one upset is guaranteed for each run. COAST can be instructed to keep track of the number of corrected faults via the flag ``-countErrors``. This flag allows the program to detect corrected upsets, which yields more precise results on the number of radiation-induced SEUs. This option is only applicable to TMR because DWC halts on the first error. A global variable, ``TMR_ERROR_CNT``, is incremented each time that all three copies of the datum do not agree. If this global is not present in the source code then the pass creates it. The user can print this value at the end of program execution, or read it using a debugging tool.

**Error Handlers**\ : The user has the choice of how to handle DWC and CFCSS errors because these are uncorrectable. The default behavior is to create ``abort()`` function calls if errors are detected. However, user functions can be called in place of ``abort()``. In order to do so, the source code needs a definition for the function ``void FAULT_DETECTED_DWC()`` or ``void FAULT_DETECTED_CFCSS()`` for DWC and CFCSS, respectively.

**Input Initialization**\ : Global variables with initial values provide an interesting problem for testing. By default, these initial values are assigned to each replicate at compile time. This models the scenario where the SoR expands into the source of the data. However, this does not accurately model the case when code inputs need to be replicated at runtime. This could happen, for instance, if a UART was feeding data into a program and storing the result in a global variable. When global variables are listed using ``-runtimeInitGlbls`` the pass inserts ``memcpy()`` calls to copy global variable data into the replicates at runtime. This supports scalar values as well as aggregate data types, such as arrays and structures.

**Interleaving**\ : In previous work replicated instructions have all been placed immediately after the original instructions. Interleaving instructions in this manner effectively reduces the number of available registers because each load statement executes repeatedly, causing each original value to occupy more registers. For TMR, this means that a single load instruction in the initial code uses three registers in the protected program. As a result, the processor may start using the stack as extra storage. This introduces additional memory accesses, increasing both the code size and execution time. Placing each set of replicated instructions immediately before the next synchronization point lessens the pressure on the register file by eliminating the need for multiple copies of data to be live simultaneously.

By default, COAST groups copies of instructions before synchronization points, effectively partitioning regions of code into segments where each copy of the program runs uninterrupted. Alternately, the user can specify that instructions should be interleaved using ``-i``.

**Printing Status Messages**\ : Using the ``-verbose`` flag will print more information about what the pass is doing. This includes removing unused functions and unused global strings.

If you are developing passes, then on occasion you might need to include more printing statements. Using the ``-dumpModule`` flag causes the pass to print out the entirety of the LLVM module to the command line in LLVM IR format.


.. _dbg_tools:

Debugging Tools
=================

COAST verbose output
--------------------

As mentioned above, COAST supports the ``-verbose`` and ``-dumpModule`` flags.  The ``-verbose`` output lists alls of the in-code directives processed, which functions are having their signatures changed, as well as any unused globals or functions being removed.  COAST will also print warnings or errors about unsupported language constructs being used.

Using the ``-dumpModule`` flag is useful to get an idea of what COAST is doing if it's failing to finish compilation.  The function ``dumpModule()`` can also be placed in different places in the code for additional debugging capabilities.  Since the module will be output to the ``stderr`` stream, and it can be quite a lot of data, it is important to redirect the output properly.

Example: ``opt -TMR -dumpModule input.bc -o output.bc > dump.ll 2>&1``


Debug Statements
-----------------

By default, the Debug Statements pass will add code to the beginning of every basic block that prints out the function name followed by the name of the basic block.  For example, you would expect the first message to be ``main->entry``.  This can produce 100s of MegaBytes of data, so it is important to redirect this output to a file, as shown in the example above.  This verbose output represents a complete call graph of the execution, although trawling through all of this data can be quite difficult.

.. versionadded:: 1.2

There is an option to only add print statements to certain functions.  Pass ``-fnPrintList=`` with a comma-separated list of function names that will be instrumented with the print statements.  This will allow examining smaller parts of the execution at a time.


Small Profiler
-----------------

.. versionadded:: 1.2

The Small Profiler is a pass which simply counts the number of calls to each function in the module.  It creates global variables that correspond to each function in the module.  Each time a function is called, the corresponding global variable is incremented.  The pass adds a call to a function named ``PRINT_PROFILE_STATS`` immediately before the ``main`` function exits.  If the program does not terminate, calls to this function may be inserted manually by the programmer.

This pass also has two command line parameters:

.. table::
    :widths: 25 40

    | Command line option       | Effect                                              |
    +===========================+=====================================================+
    |                           | The name of the function that is used to print      |
    |      ``printFnName``      | the stats.  The default is ``printf``.  This flag   |
    |                           | is for if the platform does not support ``printf``. |
    +---------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
    |      ``noPrint``          | Do not insert the call to ``PRINT_PROFILE_STATS``.  |
